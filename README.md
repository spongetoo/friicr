-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

before we begin the tootorial, what does it DO, and what does it HAVE?

- tries to make it accurate just like the real 2002 Symphonic W802 VCR/DVD combo (holy sheet, just like the tape wormy intended!)
- all packaged within 1 json file and an audio file
- 525 lines (480p) to make it ùì™ùì¨ùì¨ùìæùìªùì™ùìΩùìÆ (instead of 720p)
- i forgor

# now... onto the Ôº¥ÔºØÔºØÔº¥ÔºØÔº≤Ôº©Ôº°Ôº¨Ôº≥ !!!!!!!!!!!!!! (yes yes i'm so happy about this information)

step 0 -- make a video lol (i recommend using obs) (if you already have a vid that you can 'convert' to, go to step 1 instead)

step 1 -- clone the repo, then download, install then open your favorite video editor (for example, CapCut)

step 2 -- make a new project, throw the video and the vhs noise in there, and make sure that it fits thru the video; if it too long you'll have to put another vhs noise in there, and once again make sure that it fits thru the LOOOOOOOONG video (more like it fits thru that one deez nuts in your mouth gottem)

step 3 -- reduce the decibel to -7.0 (19.952623149688797%/20% holy fucking shit aaaaaaaaaaaa***aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa***)

then render the vid at 29.97(6) fps (if the vid editor doesn't have that use 30fps)

step 4 -- [GET ntsc-rs from github / valadaptive](https://github.com/valadaptive/ntsc-rs/releases/latest) and open it up (BETTER THAN NTSCQT.............)

step 5 -- import the json preset included in this repo, then the video file

step 6 -- scale it to 525 scanlines then render as a new mp4 file (quality set to 50, encoder speed set to 4, 4:2:0 chroma subsampling checked, h264 codec)

step 7 -- [download install and whip up your copy of handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) (most trusted source trust me)

step 8 -- drop yo vid to handbrake, configure then let 'em cook (save both of these presets in the future in case you wanna do it again!)
- make sure that all the options are default, then...
- dimensions storage size 352x240, display size 319, no crop, uncheck optimal size
- no filters
- video same framerate as source, variable framerate, constant quality 16 rf, encoder level auto
- audio bitrate 64, stereo, sample rate 11.025, no gain
- no subs
- no chapters

step 9 -- drop yo handbraked vid into handbrake, once again configure, most is the same as previous but then there's the new changes, and then let 'em cook once again
- web optimized
- resolution limit 480p ntsc sd, optimal size, no crop, allow upscaling, constant quality 18 rf

step 10 -- wait

step 11 -- see the results

step 12 -- HOLY FUCKING SHIT DUDE IT THE REAL VHS THAT IS RECORDED ON THE 2002 SYMPHONIC W802 VCR/DVD COMBO

# onto the questions !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Q: are you tapeworm**

A: no, i'm spongetoo

**Q: is this accurate to the reel vhs**

A: nah, it pretends to be 'accurate'

**Q: are these malware/stuff that can hack into ur accounts**

A: no, all of these files/links i've provided are virus free, if it gets detected call it a false positive; alternatively, scan it on virustotal

**Q: but i'm scared**

A: well if you want to be 100% completely completely sure take a look at the source code of the links i've provided for yourself, for video editors make sure that you've downloaded it and installed it on the microsoft store that has a verified publisher on it/official websites, not the unofficial ones that gives you virus

**Q: but i don't want to do that, i don't want to take a look at the source code and then rebuild it for myself, i don't want no virus, i don't want vcr and tapeworm all sort that stuff, i just wanted to make free tapesssssssssss**

A: fuck you
